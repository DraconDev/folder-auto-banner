- Languages breakdown with percentages
- Build timing display
- Cached test results display
- Permission modes: rwx, octal, disable
- Column selection (show/hide columns)

## [0.3.0] - 2024-05-30

### Changed
- **Major simplification**: Removed 15+ commands that duplicate existing tools

- Navigation: `pin`, `unpin`, `pins`, `jump`, `root` — redundant with frecency
- Sessions: `save-session`, `load-session`, `sessions`, `delete-session` — over-engineering
- Other: `diff`, `do`, `peek`, `stats`, `config` — niche or over-engineered
- Flags: `--no-build-check`, `--no-todos`, `--no-ports`, `--no-docker`, `--no-metrics` — use env vars
